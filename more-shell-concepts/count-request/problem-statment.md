We have a few different applications running on this system. The list of applications are stored at /tmp/assets/apps.txt file.

Each application has it's logs stored in /var/log/apps directory under a file with its name. Check it out!

A simple version of the script has been developed that inspects the log file of an application and prints the number of GET, POST, and DELETE requests. Update the script to use a for loop to read the list of applications from the apps.txt file and count number of requests for each application and display it in a tabular format like this.

Log name GET POST DELETE
